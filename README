A simple module that adds the switch case functionality to Python.  

To use:
1) Place pyswitch.py somewhere in your PYTHONPATH

2) Import switch from pyswitch   
from pyswitch import switch

3) Call the switch() function with the value you want to test against.
   This will in turn create the case() and default() functions for that Switch object.

switch(birthyear)

3) The case() function takes three arguments.
   a) The value to test against.
   b) Code to execute if that value is true.
   c) Whether or not prevent further cases from executing.
      This is represented by a 0 for pass, and a 1 for break.
      It will default to 1, so you only need to specify when to pass.

code = 'print ("You must be 18 or older to view this site.")'
case(1992, code, 0)

4) Call the default function for a default case. This only requires code to execute.
default(code)

An example of usage can be seen in the switchtest.py file.
